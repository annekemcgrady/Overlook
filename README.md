## Setup

Clone down this repo.  You can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```
Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
Run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see the page.
