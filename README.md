# Overlook

## Project Description
Overlook is a hotel management site.  The intended user is a hotel manager.  The site consists of a dashboard with four tabs.  the initial view is a general overview of hotel statistics.  On the Guest tab, a guest can be selected or a new guest can be created.  Once either of those events have happened the view on the tabs switches to information that is specific to the selected guest.

## Setup

Clone down this repo.  You can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```
Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

npm install
```
Run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see the page.
